# music.voik.xyz

This is a minimal page built to showcase tracks that I'm currently working on.

It's built on Vue and the HTML5 <audio> element, and is fully responsive.

## Development

Run `npm run serve` to start the Vue development server.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to output a bundled distribution suitable for serving to `./dist/`

## Serving

`./dist` can be served with any HTTP server, e.g. `cd dist/; python3 -m http.server`
